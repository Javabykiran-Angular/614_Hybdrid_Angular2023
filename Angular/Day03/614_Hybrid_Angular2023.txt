1 what is angular ?
 - it is front end technology
 - It is a freamwork
 - Angular (google) , React js(facebook ), embber js,vue js , JSP

Why Angular?/ advantage of Angular ?/ explain the features of angular?

- Angular is a platform that makes it easy to build applications with the web.
- Angular have module ,declarative templates, dependency injection, services ,end to end tooling, and integrated best practices to solve development challenges. 

- Angular build applications that live on the web, mobile,or the desktop.

- Angular has matured into a client-side MVW framework  (i.e. Model-View-Whatever) for building of complex single page Application.

- It places equal importance on application testing & application writing, while simplifying the development process.

- Angular has tag line One framework Mobile & desktop,web.

- Cross platform Progressive web apps (i.e. It support all platform mobile,desktop,different os)

- It famous also for his speed & performance (bcz it is optimized for today's javascript virtual machine)

- It is universal framework (i.e. node.js with express js,.net,php,java & other servers for near-instants server side language)

- It has code splitting
	- It has in build router system to load quickly
	- Users only load code required to render the view they request.
	
- You can create Quick UI views with simple & powerful template syntax.

- Angular is in build CLI(Command Line Interface) Tool,so you fast building,add components & tests it.


index.html

<html>
	<head></head>
	<body><body>
</html>


SPA - Single Page Application
It contain only 1head+1 body
SPA environment in the browser â€” no page reloads, no extra wait time.
Angular These are, many E.g:
Gmail, Google Maps, GitHub.

1 Discussion of Test
2 Angular Arch. Overview
	- Angular is component orientated arch.
	- component 
		1 view file => .html => 1
		2 stylesheet file => .css => multiple 
		3 component => .ts file  => 1 
		4 testing file => .spec.ts 
		
		- it has metadata=> It holds extra information about components
		@Component({
			selector:''
			templateUrl:'./...',
			StyleUrls:'..'
		})
	- data binding
	 - it flows a data from component file to view file 
	 - It is one directiuon data flow so it is called one way data binding
	1 String interpolation
	2 Property Binding
	3 Style binding
	4 class binding
 - Event Binding
	- it flows a data/http request  from view to component
	- data is flow in one way direction 
	- click,change, k/b,mouse event, custom event 
 - Directives
	- it change / manipulate the behaviour or your dom Structor dynamically 
	- 1 Attribute 
		ngStyle,ngClass..
	  2 component 
		..<router-outlet>
		
	  3 structural dirctive
		*ngIf,*ngFor,...
	  4 event directive
 - AppModule =>
	- It is module file 
	- It has one root module => AppModule 
	- it has multiple custom module is present.
 	
	1 declartion
		- To register a component
		- to create its factory class 
	2 import 
		- to register ur module 
		- or if u want use inbuild angular module 
	3 Services
		- it is simple class 
		- it write a BL
		- code maintain
		- reuse
		- DI => it is key to used service effectively 
		
	4 routing
		- It is used to navigate from one component to another 
		- u can send a data from one to other 
		- u can apply security 
		- u can used lazy loading 
  - Injector 
	- It is used For DI 
	- u can register any 3rd party services/module
	- In built angular service/module u can inject
